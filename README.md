# P2000T SCART adapter plate

Small four-layer PCB to interface the six wires of the RGBS port with a 
SCART connector.

## Purpose

To interface a P2000T with a SCART-compatible monitor or television, a couple
of resistors need to be placed. This PCB accomodates the resistors in a small
0805 form factor and allows for a sturdy connection with the SCART connector.
